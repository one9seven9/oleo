# oleo
Oleo is build on the ideas simplicity and flexibility.  There is a lot of good stuff already out there.  We reuse when it makes sense but we’ll also create project forks and adapt those projects to follow some of the foundational code we use to make those projects play nice together.  We want users to be able to mix and match the pieces they like from different projects.

Hopefully something amazing will come from this.  If you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out.

## Simplicity

There are a lot of smart people out there, most of them are far smarter than I am.  Sometimes they’re too smart for their own good.  As a UX engineer and a consumer of software, I’ve learned that a lot of stuff out there is over-engineered and over-complicated and because of that it never really catches on or sees the light of day.  I’m hoping to make this simple and easily consumed.  I’ve chosen Svelte as the foundational code and compiler that it’s build on but the project will also generate web-components.
